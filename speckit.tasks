- [ ] T017 [US1] Add UI formatting for tasks display in display.py
- [ ] T018 [US1] Test User Story 1 acceptance scenarios independently

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Update and Complete Tasks (Priority: P2)

- [ ] T019 [US2] Implement update_task functionality in task_manager.py with validation
- [ ] T020 [US2] Implement complete_task functionality in task_manager.py to toggle completion
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement delete_task functionality in task_manager.py
- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Create unit tests for update_task functionality in tests/test_task_manager.py
- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Create unit tests for complete_task functionality in tests/test_task_manager.py
- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Create unit tests for delete_task functionality in tests/test_task_manager.py
- [ ] T025 [US2] Implement update command in main.py console interface
- [ ] T026 [US2] Implement complete command in main.py console interface
- [ ] T027 [US2] Implement delete command in main.py console interface
- [ ] T028 [US2] Test User Story 2 acceptance scenarios independently

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Error Handling (Priority: P3)

- [ ] T029 [US3] Implement error handling for invalid commands in main.py
- [ ] T030 [US3] Implement error handling for non-existent task operations in task_manager.py
- [ ] T031 [US3] Add validation for empty titles in models.py and task_manager.py
- [ ] T032 [US3] Add validation for title length (max 200 chars) in models.py and task_manager.py
- [ ] T033 [US3] Add validation for description length (max 1000 chars) in models.py and task_manager.py
- [ ] T034 [P] [US3] Create unit tests for error handling scenarios in tests/test_validation.py
- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Create unit tests for invalid task operations in tests/test_task_manager.py
- [ ] T036 [US3] Test User Story 3 acceptance scenarios independently

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T037 Add type hints to all functions in src/ following constitution requirements
- [ ] T038 Add docstrings to all functions and classes in src/ following constitution requirements
- [ ] T039 Implement help command in main.py showing available commands
- [ ] T040 Implement exit command in main.py with graceful shutdown
- [ ] T041 Add timestamp handling to Task model with timezone awareness
- [ ] T042 Complete all unit tests and ensure 80%+ code coverage
- [ ] T043 Run full integration test of all features working together
- [ ] T044 Perform performance validation (start < 1s, operations < 100ms)

## Dependencies

- **User Story 2** depends on: User Story 1 (core add/list functionality needed for update/delete/complete)
- **User Story 3** depends on: User Story 1 and 2 (error handling built on working features)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **T002, T003, T006**: Project setup tasks can run in parallel
- **T005, T009, T010**: Model and test creation can run in parallel
- **T013, T014**: US1 testing tasks can run in parallel with implementation
- **T022, T023, T024**: US2 testing tasks can run in parallel with implementation
- **T032, T033, T034**: US3 validation tasks can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1 (setup) + Phase 2 (foundational) + Phase 3 (US1) for basic functionality
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story phase delivers independently testable functionality
3. **Constitution Compliance**: All code follows Python 3.14, UV package manager, type hints, and testing requirements
4. **Testing Approach**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for complete workflows

## Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Can be tested by starting app, adding a task, viewing the list, confirming task exists
- **US2**: Can be tested by adding multiple tasks, updating one, marking one complete, verifying changes
- **US3**: Can be tested by entering invalid commands and verifying helpful error messages without crashes
